# AISTM7 Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy AISTM7 to Netlify with all required services and configurations.

## Prerequisites

1. Netlify Account
2. Required Environment Variables:
   - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify authentication token
   - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret for NextAuth.js
   - `SOLANA_RPC_URL`: Solana RPC endpoint
   - `TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS`: AISTM7 token mint address
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI features
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL database URL
   - Email configuration:
     - `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`
     - `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`
     - `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`
     - `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`
     - `EMAIL_FROM`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Initial Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd aistm7

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend/netlify/functions && npm install && cd ../../..
```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
2. Add all required environment variables listed in Prerequisites

3. **Deploy to Netlify**

```bash
# Make deploy script executable
chmod +x frontend/scripts/deploy.sh

# Run deployment
cd frontend && ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Architecture Overview

The deployment consists of:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Next.js application deployed to Netlify
   - Static assets served via Netlify CDN
   - Client-side React components with TypeScript

2. **Serverless Functions**
   - API endpoints in `netlify/functions`
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Blockchain integration via Solana
   - AI/ML model serving

3. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL database (hosted separately)
   - Connected via prisma client

4. **External Services**
   - Solana blockchain integration
   - AI model inference
   - Email notifications

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Netlify Dashboard**
   - Monitor build status
   - View deployment logs
   - Check function execution

2. **Logs**
   - Function logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Application logs via configured logging service

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor function execution times
   - Check CDN cache performance
   - Review WebSocket connections

## Troubleshooting

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure dependencies are installed

2. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check function logs
   - Verify API endpoints
   - Check WebSocket connections

3. **Database Issues**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check database connection
   - Review prisma client logs

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - All sensitive data stored in Netlify environment variables
   - No secrets in code repository

2. **API Security**
   - Authentication via NextAuth.js
   - API routes protected with middleware
   - CORS configured for production domain

3. **WebSocket Security**
   - Secure WebSocket connections (wss://)
   - Authentication required for subscriptions
   - Rate limiting implemented

## Scaling

The application scales automatically with Netlify's infrastructure:

1. **CDN**
   - Static assets globally distributed
   - Automatic cache invalidation

2. **Functions**
   - Auto-scaling based on demand
   - Concurrent execution support

3. **WebSocket**
   - Connection pooling
   - Auto-reconnection handling

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Database**
   - Regular automated backups
   - Point-in-time recovery available

2. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables backed up
   - Deployment configuration in version control

## Updates and Maintenance

1. **Frontend Updates**
   - Automatic deployment on main branch updates
   - Preview deployments for pull requests

2. **Function Updates**
   - Deploy with frontend updates
   - Zero-downtime deployments

3. **Database Migrations**
   - Run migrations during deployment
   - Backward compatible changes

## Support

For deployment issues or questions:
1. Check Netlify status page
2. Review deployment logs
3. Contact support team

Remember to keep all environment variables and sensitive information secure and never commit them to version control.
